# After Railway deployment, update your claude_desktop_config.json to:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quickcalc-mcp-server": {
      "url": "https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/mcp/"
    }
  }
}

# Example:
# If your Railway URL is: https://fast-mcp-production-abc123.up.railway.app
# Then your config should be:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quickcalc-mcp-server": {
      "url": "https://fast-mcp-production-abc123.up.railway.app/mcp/"
    }
  }
}

# Note: Always add "/mcp/" to the end of your Railway URL
